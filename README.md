## About

This is a ground-up rewrite of the great `pwnlib` for Python 2. There were a
number of attempts to port `pwnlib` to Python 3, but they all appear abandoned.
In addition, they still had a bunch of issues with the changes in Python 3,
especially when it comes to the handling of binary data.

`xply` does not have nearly the range of features that `pwnlib` has (although
more will be added over time), but was written from the ground up with Python 3
in mind.

## Setup

You can install `xply` using `pip`:

```bash
pip install 'git+https://github.com/tobiasholl/xply.git'
```

Once the API is somewhat stable, there will (probably) also be a PyPI package
that tracks the release versions.

`xply` requires at least Python 3.7 (for `from __future__ import annotations`).
